      Danielle Havens is a seasoned attorney and dedicated public servant with over 23 years of courtroom experience in Western Washington. A proud graduate of the University of Washington and Seattle University School of Law, Danielle has spent her legal career advocating for justice in the communities she loves.<br/><br/>
      Danielle's legal work has spanned criminal defense, family law, victim advocacy, protection orders, and specialty courts focused on mental health, addiction, veterans, and community wellness. For the majority of her career, she worked alongside her longtime mentor, Tim Milios, a respected trial lawyer. She has appeared in courtrooms throughout the state, with most of her work taking place in the municipal and district courts of King, Pierce, and Snohomish counties.<br/><br/>
      Since 2021, Danielle has served as a Judge Pro Tempore in courts across the region, including Federal Way, Kent, Renton, Puyallup, and others. She is widely respected for her fair, impartial, and compassionate approach—balancing accountability with humanity. Danielle believes strongly that every person in the courtroom—whether defendant, prosecutor, juror, or court staff—deserves to be treated with dignity and respect.<br/><br/>
      Her experience has taught her that the courtroom can be a powerful place for change. Danielle sees the law not just as a tool for justice but as a way to support healing and growth. Since early 2024, she has served as the weekly back-up judge for the therapeutic DUI Court Program in Kent, where she's followed participants through structured programs aimed at addressing the root causes of criminal behavior—such as addiction, trauma, or mental illness. She is deeply passionate about this work and excited to contribute more to Federal Way's successful community court program.<br/><br/>
      While Danielle supports treatment and rehabilitation, she also believes in personal accountability. She understands that consequences are part of the legal process, and she imposes them fairly, always helping people understand the "why" behind decisions. Her philosophy is simple: once a consequence is served, it's time to move forward—equipped with new choices and better tools.<br/><br/>
      Danielle's path to the bench has been shaped by both professional and personal experience. A Seattle native, she raised her two children as a single parent while attending law school, relying on the support of her family and community to pursue her dreams. That deep appreciation for local support inspires her every day. Her story is one of resilience, balance, and an unwavering commitment to service.<br/><br/>
      Today, Danielle lives in West Seattle, close to her grown children, her beloved cats, and the family that raised her. Her parents, retired educators, live in Winthrop, WA, and she cherishes their regular family gatherings filled with music and laughter. When she's not in court, Danielle enjoys Pilates, volunteering at the West Seattle Food Bank, brunch with friends, and reading in cozy spots with great coffee and pastries.<br/><br/>
      Danielle Havens is ready to bring her decades of experience, thoughtful leadership, and deep respect for the law to the bench full-time. She's running for Municipal Court Judge to serve her community with integrity, compassion, and fairness—ensuring that everyone who enters the courtroom is heard, respected, and treated justly.
