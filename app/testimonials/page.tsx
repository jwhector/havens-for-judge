        "Before meeting Danielle, I felt hopeless and overwhelmed, but her guidance restored my faith in the possibility of recovery. She set me up for success in the legal system. After violating a deferred prosecution agreement set up by a previous attorney, Danielle recognized that my mental health diagnosis was a factor in my case and had it referred to King County District Court Mental Health Court. She worked tirelessly to create the support and structure I needed to learn from my mistakes, exit the legal system, and move forward with my life. Her compassion and commitment to justice, demonstrated throughout my case, will make her an exceptional judge who truly strives for fairness and understanding.",

        "When I think of Danielle, I think of a human being so compassionate and so true to her calling: helping people. Her dedication is hard to find in the world we live in. Having an adult child become part of the legal system due to mental health issues is not something I could have ever dreamt of. Without her exceptional knowledge, compassion, and unending support, I could not imagine seeing a day where my child is out of legal trouble and moving on with his life. My family and I have the mental peace that we have today because of Danielle and her above and beyond commitment to service.",

Danielle supports clients not only professionally, but also personally. Danielle has helped me take accountability for my actions, and has supported my personal growth. I am in a much better place in my life after working with Danielle. Danielle cares for and advocates for her clients. I would not trust anyone else.",

        "I am Danielle's biggest supporter. I cannot imagine anyone more fit to serve as a judge than Danielle Havens. I have known her my entire career to be one of the fiercest advocates for her clients, articulate in a way I have attempted to copy, and one of the best Moms that I have ever known. She was always a Mom first and a lawyer second when her children were growing up. And I learned all about that from her whether she realized it or not. Danielle is an amazing role model to the people around her and I am honored to support her campaign. I think she is brilliant, funny, compassionate, and deeply empathetic. she is and will be the best Judge.",

        "I've known Danielle for her entire life, and I've watched her use both her heart and mind to advocate for fairness, justice and kindness. She has always been a unique problem solver. Her passion and intellect led her into law, and her wisdom has made her an outstanding pro-tempore judge. Federal Way will be well-served to have her in the Municipal Court, Position 2.",

        "Anybody who votes in Federal Way needs to know about this opportunity to vote for a truly amazing judge and person!! I have known my dear friend, Danielle, for at least 25 years. I am an artist and a registered nurse. As an artist, I am inspired by her presence. As a nurse, I value her integrity. She married my husband and me in 2022. We are forever grateful that she honored our intentions, values, and our family and friends. In my personal experience as her friend, I can tell you she is direct and clear and communicates with a type of unique compassion. She's passionate about life and full of hope for each person she encounters. She speaks with a kind of effortless courage. She lifts people up. Danielle listens; she guides those around her with wisdom, experience, and care. Federal Way is so lucky to have Danielle as a force for justice and goodness!",

In every case, Danielle approaches the law with both a sharp mind and a generous heart, ensuring that everyone is heard and treated with dignity. I can't think of anyone more qualified to bring these values to the bench. Our community would be lucky to have Danielle as a judge, and I'm proud to support her campaign!",
