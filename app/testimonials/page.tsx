        "Anybody who votes in Federal Way needs to know about this opportunity to vote for a truly amazing judge and person!! I have known my dear friend, Danielle, for at least 25 years. I am an artist and a registered nurse. As an artist, I am inspired by her presence. As a nurse, I value her integrity. She married my husband and me in 2022. We are forever grateful that she honored our intentions, values, and our family and friends. In my personal experience as her friend, I can tell you she is direct and clear and communicates with a type of unique compassion. She's passionate about life and full of hope for each person she encounters. She speaks with a kind of effortless courage. She lifts people up. Danielle listens; she guides those around her with wisdom, experience, and care. Federal Way is so lucky to have Danielle as a force for justice and goodness!",

        "I've had the privilege of working alongside Danielle and seeing firsthand the qualities that make her exceptional â€” deep legal knowledge, unwavering integrity, compassion for the people she serves, and a genuine commitment to fairness and justice. In every case, Danielle approaches the law with both a sharp mind and a generous heart, ensuring that everyone is heard and treated with dignity. I can't think of anyone more qualified to bring these values to the bench. Our community would be lucky to have Danielle as a judge, and I'm proud to support her campaign!",
